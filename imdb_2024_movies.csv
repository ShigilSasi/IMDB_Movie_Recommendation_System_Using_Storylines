Watching you - Die Welt von Palantir und Alex Karp,"For the first time, a documentary examines US entrepreneur Alex Karp and his mysterious and insular company, Palantir. Along with Elon Musk, his co-founder Peter Thiel, and Sam Altman, the CEO of Palantir is considered one of the most important digital leaders. Like them, Karp is benefiting from the election of Donald Trump as US president. But he is still relatively unknown in this country - even though German police authorities also work with Palantir's software, Gotham. The successful yet controversial data analysis program specializes in bundling and visualizing large amounts of data for the purpose of intelligence gathering and surveillance. Gotham can create profiles of individuals worldwide through digital data analysis. The software supports intelligence agencies, the military, and police authorities, the latter also in Hesse and Bavaria, with information that can be used, for example, in the fight against terrorism - or for targeted killings. Palantir is currently an important partner of Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. The company rose to prominence through its work for the CIA and NSA. With their help, Osama Bin Laden is said to have been brought down. In 2024, Palantir was temporarily valued at over $220 billion on the stock market. One founder, Peter Thiel, is a right-wing libertarian and Trump supporter. The other, Alex Karp, describes himself as a ""neo-Marxist and leftist,"" holds a doctorate in philosophy from Frankfurt, and likes to mention that his parents were ""hippies."" He even offers Thai Chi classes for his employees - and teaches them himself. Today, he leads the world's largest commercial surveillance company as CEO.

After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future. In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time (2019)) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis. As a complex battle played out on remote logging roads, in the legal system and in the court of public opinion, authorities staged a steady propaganda campaign, alongside stalling tactics and a police presence, to undermine the Haida cause. With the whole world watching, would the Haida hold fast to their strategy of peaceful resistance, or would violence erupt? The parallels between past and present continue to resound, as the Lyell Island blockade laid the foundations for current land-claim treaties across Canada. From the Haida Nation's resolute act of vision and conscience emerged an unbreakable commitment to justice, solidarity and Indigenous sovereignty that echoes forth to this day."

Le cinquième plan de La Jetée,"In the Chris Marker exhibition at the Cinémathèque Française, my cousin Jean-Henri recognized himself in La Jetée. Seen from behind, the photo of him and his parents on the observation deck of Orly Airport is the fifth shot of the film. If it's him, he was the hero of the film as a child. Our whole family recognized them, and I was drawn to his vision and the secret paths it opened up into our family history and the story of these images. It was at Orly Airport that we arrived from Algeria in 1962. As for Marker... Because images imprint themselves on our consciousness, films can and do belong to us. And few films have been more dear to history than Chris Marker's La Jetée (1962), a minimalist masterpiece often ranked among the greatest and most influential. But as acclaimed director Dominique Cabrera belatedly discovers in her latest feature, Marker's science-fiction photo-montage might also be an unwitting historical document about her own family. La Jetée was made the very year Algerian independence was declared, and at a time when hundreds of thousands of French people of Algerian descent, like Cabrera's family, were retreating to Paris via Orly Airport. Sixty years later, the director's cousin is convinced that it is he who appears in the fifth frame of the film, standing next to his parents as they greet their loved ones at the airport.

It is a story of mystery, intrigue, glamour, stardom, poverty, loneliness, and most of all, the extraordinary love and devotion of sisters.

These artists recognize themselves in Nita & Zita as the ultimate bohemian outsider artists. Nita & Zita performed all over the world before retiring to a creole cottage in New Orleans where they became eccentric recluses, but they weren't done creating. They painted their house top to bottom with flowers and polka dots and surrounded themselves with photos from their dancer days. After they died, their neighbor found thousands of hand-sewn costumes, dolls, dresses, and art that were then sold in a yard sale that lasted 5 years. Many artists in New Orleans and around the world own Nita & Zita costume pieces, where they are now literally woven into the fabric of the city. Nita & Zita are buried in the pauper's section of the Hebrew Rest Cemetery in New Orleans. Filmmakers Marci Darling and Sharon Gillen are passionate about smashing Jewish stereotypes, gender stereotypes, dancer stereotypes, and socioeconomic injustices through innovative visual storytelling.

Deep State Gangsters,"Deep State Gangsters is a full-length feature documentary that exposes the abuse of state power by the United States national security establishment, also known as the Deep State. This unique cinematic experience pulls back the curtain on this shadowy world. It features a captivating cast of characters and unveils a bureaucratic machine that destroys dissent to preserve its power. The cast of characters includes two CIA and two FBI whistleblowers who provide their firsthand experiences of blowing the whistle and receiving retribution for their efforts to hold the Deep State accountable for violations of laws. John C. Kiriakou: John served in the Central Intelligence Agency from 1990 to 2004, first as an analyst and later as a counterterrorism operations officer. He became the sixth whistleblower indicted by the Obama administration under the Espionage Act-a law designed to punish spies. John served twenty-three months in prison as a result of his revelations, which included disclosures on the CIA's use of torture against prisoners. He was targeted for prosecution by the Director of the CIA, John Brennan, in an act of vindictiveness that abused state power against a lawful whistleblower protected by the law. In the film, John provides firsthand commentary on his experiences as a CIA officer and whistleblower. Pedro Israel Orta: Pedro served in the Central Intelligence Agency from 2000 to 2018 as an analyst, operations officer, counterintelligence officer, technical targeting officer, deputy chief of base in a warzone, and technical operations officer. Orta served as an inspector in the Office of the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community and multiple war zone tours in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other undisclosed locations-earning eight exceptional performance awards. But he was fired one year shy of retirement after numerous rounds of reprisals for blowing the whistle. Pedro walks the viewer through his story as a CIA officer and whistleblower. Garret O'Boyle: Garret bravely stepped forward as a Congressional whistleblower disclosing FBI abuses of power. His journey began as an infantryman in the United States Army, where he courageously served multiple deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning the esteemed Combat Infantryman's Badge. Garret exemplified dedication to his country as part of the 25th Infantry Division and the storied 101st Airborne Division. Transitioning to a new chapter post-military, he joined the FBI as a Special Agent, continuing his commitment to service. However, his allegiance to truth led him to make protected disclosures to Congress, resulting in unjust retaliation from within his agency. Despite facing suspension without pay, Garret remains resolute - a devoted Christian, husband, and father-undaunted by the challenges he confronts. Garret relives the trauma he suffered as e tells his deeply moving personal story. Nate Cain: Nate's civil rights were trampled through the FBI's unconstitutional surveillance and raiding of his home, confiscating his personal property, and victimizing his family through intimidation and a vicious smear campaign that lasted five years. The FBI also leaked his identity to the press with misinformation in an attempt to destroy his reputation and silence him. It was all a sham investigation to cover for the profoundly corrupt Clinton machine. Nate provides a shocking exposure of the FBI's abuses of power to silence him for his bold move to blow the whistle. Two color commentators provide expert analysis of perils of the abuse of power by the Deep state and what it means for our nation. J Michael Waller: Michael is the author of ""Big Intel: How the CIA and FBI Went from Cold War Heroes to Deep State Villains."" Big Intel recounts the dramatic story of the rise and Cold War heroics of the FBI and the American intelligence apparatus, followed by its unfortunate slide into Marxist-influenced Deep State dysfunction as BIG INTEL became BAD INTEL. Michael provides expert commentary on a Deep State run amok. Lee Smith: Lee Smith is a veteran journalist whose work appears in Tablet, Real Clear Investigations, and The Federalist. He's worked in media for thirty years, writing about national politics, foreign policy, and the press. Lee is the author of ""The Permanent Coup: How Enemies Foreign and Domestic Targeted the American President.""

The Set Up,No storyline available
Per il mio bene,"Giovanna inherited the family business from her father, which deals with the industrial (but artisanal) processing of natural stone. The woman does not have a partner, and although she maintains a close relationship with her mother Lilia and her 15-year-old daughter Alida, it seems that she is unable to build completely sincere bonds with them or to be completely transparent. So when she gets sick, she keeps the situation hidden from the girl, and only talks to her mother because she discovers that the only cure would be an urgent liver transplant from a blood relative in adulthood. But Lilia cannot help her, because... she is not her biological mother. Giovanna discovers that she was adopted and that she has lived a life in the dark about that important information regarding her identity. And she begins a search for her biological mother, the only one who could really save her life. 'Per il mio bene' is an unusual film in the Italian panorama because, despite starting from a melodramatic premise with a high risk of television (and the first scenes struggle a bit to find the necessary tone), it unfolds cinematically in a sober and calm way, working ""in levare"" and relying on the rigor of its protagonists: Barbora Bobulova in the role of Giovanna, Marie-Christine Barrault - a very welcome return - in that of her biological mother, Sara Ciocca in the role of Alida and Stefania Sandrelli in that of Lilia. Sandrelli performs an act of great generosity in leaving the more substantial role (which she could have easily played herself) to her French colleague: but with a couple of ""piercing"" expressions she lets Lilia's living pain filter through in witnessing Giovanna's rejection (and illness), as only a great actress can do. However, it is Barrault who towers over the big screen, beautiful in her lonely and angry old age, and Bobulova holds her own, with sweetness and a sense of deep affinity. Ciocca closes this quadrilateral of painful but loving relationships, letting all the adolescent need for truth and affective presence shine through. 'Per il mio bene' is a treatise on motherhood as the ability to act ""for the good"" of one's children, without sacrificing the right to one's own identity. The excellent screenplay by Monica Zapelli, Pierpaolo De Mejo and Mimmo Verdesca, clear and never insistent, avoids underlining and spares us useless explanations on what we have already understood, also because the images and the acting of the actresses (and actors: there is a splendid cameo by Leo Gullotta, also a very welcome return) speak for themselves, and clearly. Verdesca's direction, at his debut in fictional cinema after some documentaries and supported by the essential editing of Alessio Doglione, is careful and modest, and takes all the time and calm necessary to tell an adult story in which the elderly are finally treated with respect and realism, or as the complex people they have been all their lives - and who do not deserve to be reduced to a single note, mostly ridiculous, in favor of the younger audience (or cast). In a delicate moment of her life, Giovanna needs the person who abandoned her, her biological mother. The precision of the images, the ability to narrate a story full of emotion without ever bordering on gratuitous tears, make Verdesca welcome as a director of fiction, capable of ""working the natural stone"" that is cinema with grace and competence. A curiosity: the names of two of the protagonists seem to be homages to his previous documentaries, 'Alida' (on Valli) and 'In arte Lilia Silvi' (on the diva of white telephones). 'Per il mio bene' therefore appears as a (further) gesture of gratitude from a man towards the women he observes, and wants to tell, with discretion and solicitude."

Last Garment of Christ,"Director Vanja Elez's film, The Last Garment of Christ, takes viewers on a fascinating, centuries-spanning journey in search of one of the most important and debated relics of the Christian world: the Shroud of Turin. Known also as the Sindone, this ancient piece of linen cloth is traditionally believed to be the material in which Jesus Christ was wrapped after his crucifixion. Through a comprehensive, investigative narrative, Elez meticulously traces the Shroud's purported path across the globe, guiding the audience from its supposed origins in Jerusalem, through the Byzantine city of Edessa and the splendor of Constantinople, all the way to its key European resting places in Lirey, Chambéry, and finally, the city of Turin, where it resides today. The film follows the relic's mystery and documents its profound, yet controversial, role throughout religious and political history. Beyond the historical narrative of the Sindone's tumultuous journey, the documentary delves into the detailed scientific research and intense scrutiny conducted on this artifact over the past decades. A special and significant focus is placed on the STURP (Shroud of Turin Research Project), a massive undertaking during which hundreds of scientists, pathologists, and technical experts from around the globe analyzed the cloth. Their collective goal was to unravel the secret of the Shroud's origin, composition, and the mysterious image imprinted upon it. Utilizing expert interviews, authenticated historical records, and the actual findings from decades of research, the audience gains a deep, multi-faceted insight into the theological, historical, and scientific complexities surrounding this unique object. The film compellingly combines faith, history, and hard science, constantly posing the central question: Is the relic authentically the burial cloth of Christ? What are the verifiable scientific facts supporting or refuting its age, and what elements remain purely in the sphere of spiritual belief? Ultimately, The Last Garment of Christ is not only a compelling story about the linen itself and the distinct image it bears, but also a narrative about the dedicated people who have studied, protected, and venerated it through the ages-from the earliest Christian communities forced to keep its existence secret, to the contemporary scientists who continue to seek empirical answers."

The Whiskey Film,"Traverse Cinema Studio presents The Whiskey Film, a visual collective of tales about those who work to define whiskey as well as themselves as they explore their craft. The key concept is that change occurs over time, not only in the whiskey itself but also in the lives of those who create it. Like the spirit in the distilling process, whiskey makers change under the pressures of their lives and within the context of their craft. Told in chapter episodic form, The Whiskey Film's characters illustrate the key influences of a great whiskey; roots, art, science, agriculture, aging, passion, tradition, focus, branding, education, and patience. Craft distilling, distilled down is an agricultural product. The more technology enters into our daily lives, the further we become removed from the process and the producers from where the products we consume every day come from. The importance of creating from your hands and the land is valued as a commodity instead of understood as a creative expression. Through the first light, over a dusty road, as the ashes of a bonfire from the previous night's tales told, swirl and dance through a faint breeze, the sun rises on a dusty field. The hazy dew point slowly begins its daily cycle from leaving the tips of each barley plant which seem to fade endlessly into the newly lit horizon. You can hear the bacon and eggs sizzling in the background and the rusty turning of an old piece of irrigation equipment. Cracks, texture, and grit consume the rusted beast that undergoes its morning maintenance before the rooster begins his routine. This is where the lives that we all live every day begin. On a farm, far away, desolate, and removed from the amplitude of a growing population. But silent, simple, and steadfast in maintaining this as their way of life."

The Truck,"The Truck is a feature-length documentary about Alex, a man who dreamed of becoming a truck driver but never had the chance to live that life. Raised in a broken family and shaped by years of hardship, his path followed a different direction - one marked by physical labor, emotional endurance, and quiet determination. Unable to drive a real truck, Alex decides to build his own. Using scrap materials and simple tools, he constructs a massive handmade trailer - a symbolic version of the vehicle he always dreamed of driving. With no engine and no mechanical assistance, Alex becomes its only source of movement. He begins transporting goods across Ukraine, covering different distances by pulling the trailer himself. The film closely follows Alex during his daily work. He delivers real cargo for real people - food, tools, and everyday necessities - moving slowly through towns, villages, and long stretches of road. His presence often surprises those he meets. Some are confused by what they see, others are skeptical, while many respond with curiosity, warmth, or unexpected generosity. There is no performance in Alex's actions and no attempt to prove anything. For him, this work is simply a way to stay useful, to keep moving, and to remain connected to a dream that once seemed impossible. The trailer has no engine - its only driving force is Alex himself: his body, his endurance, and his heart. Through patient observation and moments of reflection, The Truck becomes a portrait of a man who refuses to define himself by loss or limitation. Alex does not see his life as a tragedy. He accepts each difficulty as part of the road, approaching every challenge without self-pity or complaint. Rather than focusing on spectacle, the film invites the viewer to look closely - at routine labor, at human encounters, and at the quiet dignity found in persistence. The Truck asks simple but essential questions: What does it mean to work with purpose? How do we measure strength? And how do we choose to see those who move through the world differently than we do? At its core, The Truck is a story about motion - physical, emotional, and human. A story about continuing forward when the only engine you have is your own heart."

It Is Lit,"Christian Salmon's non-fiction book Storytelling outlines the madness of the modern neoliberal business model: constantly disrupting itself and tearing down tradition, yet demanding the total emotional investment of each worker. These conditions have definitely been internalised by the Swedish employees in It is Lit and it shows in their confused, contradictory, even sociopathic behaviours. Especially in Johan, who fears every new move in the company and plots accordingly - while hearing phantom noises of long-ago building operations. He is motivated by the dream of owning a castle - but his fantasy is erected on quicksand. Viktor Israel Strand's black-and-white, low-budget, jump-cut heavy film shows the bleak, melancholic, nightmarish underside of satirical 'office comedies' like The Boss of It All (Lars von Trier, 2006). Here there is no physical office as such: as in an early Fassbinder movie, the characters meander, gather at forlorn outdoor sites and cower under the night sky. The fragmentation of the narrative mirrors the decentredness of contemporary working conditions. Eventually reality itself dissolves. Basic human interaction is, naturally enough, the first thing to suffer in this hellish regime: Johan keeps tentatively poking his companions to check if they are actually present. The Big Question: is Johan himself even present?"

Limelight,"LIMELIGHT is a feature documentary directed by Eddie Beyrouthy (Beyond the Wasteland) that tells the story of The Salvation Army's Limelight Department, founded in Australia 1891. Specialising in what were revolutionary magic lantern shows and early film projection, music and performance, the Limelight Department became one of the world's first functioning film studios, paving the way for the birth of the Australian film industry, until it was forced to close its doors in 1910, ending a never-to-be-repeated chapter in The Salvation Army history. The documentary uncovers how Salvationist and showman, Captain Joseph Perry, with the support of Commandant Herbert Booth, augmented the army's finances and established one of the world's first film studios, and how a handful of Salvation Army officers, working out of a small attic space in The Salvation Army's building on Bourke Street, ended up producing over 400 films, including the Inauguration of the Commonwealth, the Departure of Australian troops for the Boer War, and the largest production of any narrative drama in the world at the time with Soldiers of the Cross. Limelight brings to life the stories of the first Australian pioneers of the moving image and restores an iconic piece of Australian history, and a cherished part of The Salvation Army's rich history with unseen original footage and archives, transformed using today's digital production techniques, with the addition of sound design and original music. Moreover, it examines the extraordinary and innovative lengths the church aspired to in spreading the word of the gospel on a global scale. Few people know that Melbourne had one of the world's earliest film studios and if it hadn't been forced to close in 1910 the history of Australian, and even world cinema might have been very different."

Shalivahana Shake,"Time is an illusion said Einstein, well what if we could manipulate that illusion. The story opens by contextualizing the audience with the creation of a motif that goes on to play a pivotal role in the story. This is achieved through an old lady narrating a tale to her granddaughter. The narrative of the tale being that a vendor from Satya Yuga (reference to Hindu mythology) manages to persuade Brahma (the four headed god, ascribed to the creation of the world) to create a time turner, so as to correct a wrongdoing of his past. Brahma obliges, and creates a time turner in the form of a conch shell. Having successfully corrected his past mistake, the vendor returns to Brahmaloka, to express his gratitude to Brahma in person. That is when Brahma educates him about the difference in the passage of time between earth and Brahmaloka, i.e., One day Brahmaloka is equivalent to the passage of all the four yugas (namely Satya Yuga, Tretha Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga) on earth. Having realized this and remembering the horrendous mistake of leaving the conch shell (time turner) on earth, he rushes back with lightning speed in a quest to find it, but with no luck, returns empty handed. It is at this point that the old lady ends the tale. The main story then meanders into a village setting, highlighting a group of four young men- Ranga, Suri, Daya and Pandya, each unlike the other, yet glued together by their shared love for kabaddi and swimming. ""All that happens, happens for the good"" is one idiom that holds good for what follows next. Swimming at the dam before committing to a heavy practice session of kabaddi was something that the four lads followed ritualistically, however, this time around, their plans get tweaked, for they receive information that there happens to be a crack at the dam, making it unsafe for swimming, which thereby compels them to take a dip at the nearby well. Call it an act of deliberation or call it an act of fate because, it so happens that the conch shell (time turner) finds its way into the hands of Ranga, the grandson of the little girl who was listening that old lady's tale. No sooner does he find it, than Pandya dives from an astronomical height and drowns. Panic sets in. With a dead friend, a tournament to win and strange looking conch shell, the story revolves around the lives and deaths of these four gentlemen and the time turner. It should come as no surprise to us that as the story progresses, Ranga figures out the working of that time turner compelled by his circumstances and curiosity. However, the flip side to turning time unravels itself throughout the course of the story in interestingly morbid ways. With every usage of the time turner, the stakes of risk keep getting higher, and the death of a person becomes inevitable. After numerous trials of turning time in an attempt to keep his companions and fellow villagers alive, Ranga evokes the innate human tendencies of greed and dissatisfaction, by choosing to turn time yet again. This time around, instead of yielding the result that he had expected, it takes him to a landscape of a ginormous tree on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, inhabited by a young boy with four heads holding a lotus flower in his hand. The very landscape and scenario that he had been dreaming of for all these days. If anything, it wasn't a mere act of coincidence. Afterall, as Freud would put it, dreams are pathways to our unconscious. What follows next, is up to the interpretation and amusement of the audience. Afterall, bending time comes with its repercussions, right?!"

The watchwords that govern civil coexistence in the great city are three: Order, Welfare, Security. Everything that happens in Sendai reflects this creed and seems to occur in the wake of perpetual, deadly pacification. Even the elections, where two candidates, Lukas Von Spieldorf and The Prince, clash, seem a formality to decide who will be the right-hand man of the eternal creator. But something simmers beneath the ashes that cloud the minds of Sendai's citizens. A group of mutants, supported by the old Yakuza families who ruled in the past, resist the power that nullifies the individual through cybernization, the process that merges the individual into the indistinct mass that composes society. Their armed force is the mutant Syan, a seductive woman with sapphire skin."
