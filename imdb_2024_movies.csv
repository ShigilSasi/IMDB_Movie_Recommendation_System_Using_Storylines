With Sons, eight eventful years in the making, the Newfoundland-based filmmaker confronts the challenge with imagination and creative flair, crafting a big-hearted documentary essay on parenting, patriarchy-and the pain and pleasure of guiding boys through the turbulent cultural waters of the early 21st century. Woven throughout is luminous informal footage of Jude's early years, charting his trajectory from helpless newborn to hurricane of a boy, obsessed with dinosaurs and superheroes. How can fathers steer sons away from negative models of masculinity and help them become caring adults? What does it even mean to be a ""good man""? Isn't it enough to nurture basic human qualities-empathy, confidence, common decency-without dwelling on gender? Anchoring his enquiry in his home turf, a vibrant neighbourhood in downtown St. John's, Simms enlists the help of family, friends and an engaging gang of fellow dads, all grappling with the challenge of parenting boys. ""Masculinity can be beautiful,"" observes one participant, ""but it needs a new story now.""

Dark humor, weapons and blood are part of the deal.

Inspired by a real-life case, Roh Deok's ""Contractors"" brings surprising reversals when the chain of hired killers becomes a ring too long. A moody piece set in the 1970s, ""Everyone Is Waiting for the Man"" by Chang Han-jun rounds up a group of strangers who after-hours look for a mysterious killer with a tattoo of a narcissus. ""Silent Cinema"" by Lee Myung-se unleashes a stylish series of bizarre events when diner employees are surprised by three gangsters."

Bluff City Chinese,"Bluff City Chinese is a powerful documentary following the intertwined journeys of two Chinese-American storytellers from different generations, who come together to recover and share the untold history of Chinese immigrants in Memphis, Tennessee. Directed by Thandi Cai (Anna) and featuring their mentor and Delta Chinese elder, Emerald Dunn, the film dives into the layered and challenging process of reconstructing a community's history from the ground up. Set against a backdrop of social and racial tensions, Cai and Dunn work to build an authentic record of Memphis's Chinese community, navigating profound questions of identity, belonging, and intergenerational understanding along the way. The story begins with parallel narratives: Emerald Dunn's extensive historical research, which has documented Chinese experiences in the South, and Cai's own return to Memphis in 2020. Brought together by the Chinese Historical Society during a time of increased anti-Asian sentiment nationwide, they share a sense of urgency to reclaim the voices of the past. Drawing on Dunn's independently gathered archives of photographs, genealogical records, and news clippings, they embark on a journey beyond personal discovery, inviting others from the Chinese Memphian community-ages 15 to 92-to share their stories. These conversations result in 28 collected oral histories, forming a rich 150-year long patchwork of stories and to spin a tapestry of memories, hopes, and dreams. The two storytellers then take the audience to explore the untold narratives of Chinese settlers in the Mississippi Delta. By guiding viewers through their journey, from the Main Library to historic Elmwood Cemetery and everything that happened in-between, this film invites you to reflect on the past, connect with the present, and consider the future of Chinese-American heritage in the American South. By telling this history, Cai and Dunn forge an intergenerational bond that bridges distinct upbringings and perspectives, shaped by shared experiences of fear, hope, and pride as Chinese Americans in Memphis. Reflecting this diversity, the documentary team includes first- through fourth-generation Chinese Memphians, all dedicated to capturing the community's complex and evolving identity. At its core, Bluff City Chinese is a tribute to the Chinese Memphis community-a powerful testament to how storytelling, tradition, and a shared vision for the future can bring generations together. As Cai and Dunn explore what it means to preserve their community's legacy, they reveal the resilience of a people reclaiming their narrative, ultimately offering an inspiring call for unity, identity, and the passing of wisdom from one generation to the next."

Last Garment of Christ,"Director Vanja Elez's film, The Last Garment of Christ, takes viewers on a fascinating, centuries-spanning journey in search of one of the most important and debated relics of the Christian world: the Shroud of Turin. Known also as the Sindone, this ancient piece of linen cloth is traditionally believed to be the material in which Jesus Christ was wrapped after his crucifixion. Through a comprehensive, investigative narrative, Elez meticulously traces the Shroud's purported path across the globe, guiding the audience from its supposed origins in Jerusalem, through the Byzantine city of Edessa and the splendor of Constantinople, all the way to its key European resting places in Lirey, Chambéry, and finally, the city of Turin, where it resides today. The film follows the relic's mystery and documents its profound, yet controversial, role throughout religious and political history. Beyond the historical narrative of the Sindone's tumultuous journey, the documentary delves into the detailed scientific research and intense scrutiny conducted on this artifact over the past decades. A special and significant focus is placed on the STURP (Shroud of Turin Research Project), a massive undertaking during which hundreds of scientists, pathologists, and technical experts from around the globe analyzed the cloth. Their collective goal was to unravel the secret of the Shroud's origin, composition, and the mysterious image imprinted upon it. Utilizing expert interviews, authenticated historical records, and the actual findings from decades of research, the audience gains a deep, multi-faceted insight into the theological, historical, and scientific complexities surrounding this unique object. The film compellingly combines faith, history, and hard science, constantly posing the central question: Is the relic authentically the burial cloth of Christ? What are the verifiable scientific facts supporting or refuting its age, and what elements remain purely in the sphere of spiritual belief? Ultimately, The Last Garment of Christ is not only a compelling story about the linen itself and the distinct image it bears, but also a narrative about the dedicated people who have studied, protected, and venerated it through the ages-from the earliest Christian communities forced to keep its existence secret, to the contemporary scientists who continue to seek empirical answers."

Per il mio bene,"Giovanna inherited the family business from her father, which deals with the industrial (but artisanal) processing of natural stone. The woman does not have a partner, and although she maintains a close relationship with her mother Lilia and her 15-year-old daughter Alida, it seems that she is unable to build completely sincere bonds with them or to be completely transparent. So when she gets sick, she keeps the situation hidden from the girl, and only talks to her mother because she discovers that the only cure would be an urgent liver transplant from a blood relative in adulthood. But Lilia cannot help her, because... she is not her biological mother. Giovanna discovers that she was adopted and that she has lived a life in the dark about that important information regarding her identity. And she begins a search for her biological mother, the only one who could really save her life. 'Per il mio bene' is an unusual film in the Italian panorama because, despite starting from a melodramatic premise with a high risk of television (and the first scenes struggle a bit to find the necessary tone), it unfolds cinematically in a sober and calm way, working ""in levare"" and relying on the rigor of its protagonists: Barbora Bobulova in the role of Giovanna, Marie-Christine Barrault - a very welcome return - in that of her biological mother, Sara Ciocca in the role of Alida and Stefania Sandrelli in that of Lilia. Sandrelli performs an act of great generosity in leaving the more substantial role (which she could have easily played herself) to her French colleague: but with a couple of ""piercing"" expressions she lets Lilia's living pain filter through in witnessing Giovanna's rejection (and illness), as only a great actress can do. However, it is Barrault who towers over the big screen, beautiful in her lonely and angry old age, and Bobulova holds her own, with sweetness and a sense of deep affinity. Ciocca closes this quadrilateral of painful but loving relationships, letting all the adolescent need for truth and affective presence shine through. 'Per il mio bene' is a treatise on motherhood as the ability to act ""for the good"" of one's children, without sacrificing the right to one's own identity. The excellent screenplay by Monica Zapelli, Pierpaolo De Mejo and Mimmo Verdesca, clear and never insistent, avoids underlining and spares us useless explanations on what we have already understood, also because the images and the acting of the actresses (and actors: there is a splendid cameo by Leo Gullotta, also a very welcome return) speak for themselves, and clearly. Verdesca's direction, at his debut in fictional cinema after some documentaries and supported by the essential editing of Alessio Doglione, is careful and modest, and takes all the time and calm necessary to tell an adult story in which the elderly are finally treated with respect and realism, or as the complex people they have been all their lives - and who do not deserve to be reduced to a single note, mostly ridiculous, in favor of the younger audience (or cast). In a delicate moment of her life, Giovanna needs the person who abandoned her, her biological mother. The precision of the images, the ability to narrate a story full of emotion without ever bordering on gratuitous tears, make Verdesca welcome as a director of fiction, capable of ""working the natural stone"" that is cinema with grace and competence. A curiosity: the names of two of the protagonists seem to be homages to his previous documentaries, 'Alida' (on Valli) and 'In arte Lilia Silvi' (on the diva of white telephones). 'Per il mio bene' therefore appears as a (further) gesture of gratitude from a man towards the women he observes, and wants to tell, with discretion and solicitude."

He gets baptized in a Los Angeles church, and learns English at a community college, aspiring to become a truck driver. Over the course of eight months, ""Walk the Line"" captures these migrants' extraordinary resilience and determination, and the complex journey that follows their choice. Through stunning cinematography and poignant interviews, the documentary sheds light on the profound toll of the migrant journey against the inescapable backdrop of China's tense geopolitical setting and human right crisis."

Our whole family recognized them, and I was drawn to his vision and the secret paths it opened up into our family history and the story of these images. It was at Orly Airport that we arrived from Algeria in 1962. As for Marker... Because images imprint themselves on our consciousness, films can and do belong to us. And few films have been more dear to history than Chris Marker's La Jetée (1962), a minimalist masterpiece often ranked among the greatest and most influential. But as acclaimed director Dominique Cabrera belatedly discovers in her latest feature, Marker's science-fiction photo-montage might also be an unwitting historical document about her own family. La Jetée was made the very year Algerian independence was declared, and at a time when hundreds of thousands of French people of Algerian descent, like Cabrera's family, were retreating to Paris via Orly Airport. Sixty years later, the director's cousin is convinced that it is he who appears in the fifth frame of the film, standing next to his parents as they greet their loved ones at the airport. A detective novel ensues, revealing evidence about their family, French colonialism, Marker, and the film itself.

The uprising changed the course of history, paving the way to land rights across America and to the formation of a new political group - Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party. Today, although largely forgotten, the historic uprising lives on through direct descendants of those rebellious farmers.

The Truck,"The Truck is a feature-length documentary about Alex, a man who dreamed of becoming a truck driver but never had the chance to live that life. Raised in a broken family and shaped by years of hardship, his path followed a different direction - one marked by physical labor, emotional endurance, and quiet determination. Unable to drive a real truck, Alex decides to build his own. Using scrap materials and simple tools, he constructs a massive handmade trailer - a symbolic version of the vehicle he always dreamed of driving. With no engine and no mechanical assistance, Alex becomes its only source of movement. He begins transporting goods across Ukraine, covering different distances by pulling the trailer himself. The film closely follows Alex during his daily work. He delivers real cargo for real people - food, tools, and everyday necessities - moving slowly through towns, villages, and long stretches of road. His presence often surprises those he meets. Some are confused by what they see, others are skeptical, while many respond with curiosity, warmth, or unexpected generosity. There is no performance in Alex's actions and no attempt to prove anything. For him, this work is simply a way to stay useful, to keep moving, and to remain connected to a dream that once seemed impossible. The trailer has no engine - its only driving force is Alex himself: his body, his endurance, and his heart. Through patient observation and moments of reflection, The Truck becomes a portrait of a man who refuses to define himself by loss or limitation. Alex does not see his life as a tragedy. He accepts each difficulty as part of the road, approaching every challenge without self-pity or complaint. Rather than focusing on spectacle, the film invites the viewer to look closely - at routine labor, at human encounters, and at the quiet dignity found in persistence. The Truck asks simple but essential questions: What does it mean to work with purpose? How do we measure strength? And how do we choose to see those who move through the world differently than we do? At its core, The Truck is a story about motion - physical, emotional, and human. A story about continuing forward when the only engine you have is your own heart."

The Life of Sean DeLear,"A blazingly colorful and exuberantly transgressive personality who dazzled Los Angeles' underground musical and artistic scenes in the late-1990s and 2000s, Sean DeLear (1964-2017) suddenly emerged as a genuinely seminal cultural figure via the posthumous 2022 publication of their intimate and explicit teenage diaries from 1979. I Could Not Believe It joyously chronicles the experiences of a young Black, queer creative finding their identity, voice and style decades before Barry Jenkins' (rather more downbeat) Moonlight. The Life of Sean DeLear is a vibrantly multi-faceted, buoyantly propulsive documentary portrait of this irresistibly charismatic one-off - sketched in celebratory but commendably clear-eyed style by writer-director Markus Zizenbacher. There can be very few people better qualified to do justice to this particular tale. Zizenbacher befriended DeLear - born Anthony Robertson in Simi Valley, an obscure California backwater - after the latter relocated to Vienna in the early 2010s. There the former front-person of Silver Lake post-punk-combo Glue reinvented themselves as a cabaret performer and collaborated with famed art-collective Gelitin before passing away aged just 52. ""SeanDe"" entrusted their treasure-trove audiovisual archive to Zizenbacher, who with co-editor Sebastian Schreiner has crafted an eclectic collage generously spiced with effervescent extracts from DeLear's own extensive video-diaries. These jagged hand-held snapshots bring back to often-hilarious life the electric days (and especially nights) from a quarter of a century ago, placed in retrospective context by present-day testimony from the survivors who knew SeanDe best and loved them the most. Sean DeLear - as in ""chandelier"" - lit up their world; Markus Zizenbacher now illuminates Sean DeLear for ours."

The Stand,"On a misty morning in the fall of 1985, a small group of Haida people blockaded a muddy dirt road on Lyell Island (then known as the Queen Charlotte Islands). After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future. In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time (2019)) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis. As a complex battle played out on remote logging roads, in the legal system and in the court of public opinion, authorities staged a steady propaganda campaign, alongside stalling tactics and a police presence, to undermine the Haida cause. With the whole world watching, would the Haida hold fast to their strategy of peaceful resistance, or would violence erupt? The parallels between past and present continue to resound, as the Lyell Island blockade laid the foundations for current land-claim treaties across Canada. From the Haida Nation's resolute act of vision and conscience emerged an unbreakable commitment to justice, solidarity and Indigenous sovereignty that echoes forth to this day."

Aybss Cleanup - il film,"Dell'università di robotica di Pisa Synopsis More than 90% of marine waste sinks to the seabed. The devastating impact of deep-sea marine litter is now a widespread global phenomenon, yet it remains largely invisible. ABYSS CLEANUP - THE FILM follows filmmaker and explorer Igor D'India as he investigates this hidden dimension of marine pollution, starting from his homeland, Sicily, and extending to Liguria. To address this semi-unknown aspect of the environmental crisis, he collaborates with Sea Shepherd and scientists from the CNR, combining exploration, science, and direct intervention. The documentary documents a series of underwater missions designed to locate, map, and remove waste from the seabed. Professional divers operate in complex and often hazardous conditions, while remotely operated vehicles capable of descending to depths of up to 600 meters extend the exploration beyond human limits. The film shows how abandoned fishing gear, plastics, metal objects, and industrial waste accumulate on the seafloor, where they continue to damage marine habitats long after being discarded. Among the explored locations are forgotten and rarely documented dive sites. Off the coast of Varazze, the film reveals a submerged site where approximately 1,500 cars were deliberately sunk by FIAT following the Genova flood of 1970. These vehicles, once considered a convenient disposal solution, are shown resting on the seabed decades later, transformed into sources of long-term pollution. In Sicily, the documentary intertwines environmental investigation with historical memory. The story of the sperm whale SISO is recounted through the testimony of Carmelo Isgrò at the MuMa Museum, linking scientific research, conservation, and public awareness. This narrative strand highlights the relationship between human activity, marine life, and the cultural importance of preserving marine history. The film also documents technological experimentation in underwater exploration, including the testing of the SILVER 2 crab robot, developed by the University of Pisa Robotics. The robot is deployed in challenging environments to assess new methods for surveying and interacting with polluted seabeds. Throughout the film, recovery operations are shown alongside scientific analysis of the retrieved materials, tracing their origins and persistence underwater. The documentary concludes by demonstrating that while targeted clean-up operations can remove significant amounts of waste, deep-sea pollution is the result of decades of human activity and remains an unresolved, ongoing issue requiring sustained exploration, technological innovation, and scientific collaboration."

The Whiskey Film,"Traverse Cinema Studio presents The Whiskey Film, a visual collective of tales about those who work to define whiskey as well as themselves as they explore their craft. The key concept is that change occurs over time, not only in the whiskey itself but also in the lives of those who create it. Like the spirit in the distilling process, whiskey makers change under the pressures of their lives and within the context of their craft. Told in chapter episodic form, The Whiskey Film's characters illustrate the key influences of a great whiskey; roots, art, science, agriculture, aging, passion, tradition, focus, branding, education, and patience. Craft distilling, distilled down is an agricultural product. The more technology enters into our daily lives, the further we become removed from the process and the producers from where the products we consume every day come from. The importance of creating from your hands and the land is valued as a commodity instead of understood as a creative expression. Through the first light, over a dusty road, as the ashes of a bonfire from the previous night's tales told, swirl and dance through a faint breeze, the sun rises on a dusty field. The hazy dew point slowly begins its daily cycle from leaving the tips of each barley plant which seem to fade endlessly into the newly lit horizon. You can hear the bacon and eggs sizzling in the background and the rusty turning of an old piece of irrigation equipment. Cracks, texture, and grit consume the rusted beast that undergoes its morning maintenance before the rooster begins his routine. This is where the lives that we all live every day begin. On a farm, far away, desolate, and removed from the amplitude of a growing population. But silent, simple, and steadfast in maintaining this as their way of life."

Anacostia Delta: The Legacy of DC's TeleMasters,"In September of 2015, thirty local musicians took the stage at the legendary Birchmere Concert Hall in suburban Washington DC in front of a packed house to celebrate legendary guitar player Danny Gatton and the music scene he championed, a scene with a unique style that Gatton named the ""Anacostia Delta"" sound, after the river that runs through the region he called home. This unique documentary concert film captures that musical celebration and tells the story of a hugely influential music scene that spans nearly six decades in the nation's capitol. With Gatton as the introduction, the film is a journey deep into the roots of the Anacostia Delta sound-and a celebration of its vibrancy today. The film also honors other guitar heroes of the Anacostia Delta like the late Roy Buchanan who was also labeled ""the greatest unknown guitar player in the world."" Buchanan was a blues hero to millions and remains an inspiration to many. He mentored DC native and Bruce Springsteen's guitar player, Nils Lofgren. In the 70s, Roy found the DC world so complete that he turned down an invitation to join the Rolling Stones and an invitation to record with John Lennon. Here in DC he perfected his influential sound. Buchanan and Gatton both admired another DC player-a man of enormous influence and renown, but forgotten today, Chick Hall. In an interview, Chick Jr. shares how his father's eclectic and virtuosic playing amazed country legends like Roy Clark, Jimmy Dean and Patsy Cline in the 1950s when DC was considered a country music town. Chick Jr. and brother Chris take the stage with their down home soul-inflected country sound to pay homage. We find out that it was Chick Sr. who convinced 50's rock legend Link Wray (""the father of the power chord"" and inspiration to Townshend, Jimmy Page and Iggy Pop) to come to DC. As a young musician, Danny Gatton would end up playing on ""Fire and Brimstone,"" one of Wray's hits. Through interviews and stage performances, the film introduces audiences to current DC guitar virtuosos like Tom Principato, Dave Chappell, Dan Hovey, Rick Whitehead and Chuck Underwood who still have the passion to play the intoxicating mix of blues, jazz, bluegrass and country music that Gatton played to perfection. The film leaves the audience certain that the music of this DC scene has a bright future in players like Anthony Pirog, whose mastery-inspired by Gatton-is bringing him recognition in guitar circles around the world. As the concert progresses, each act, each tune takes us deeper and deeper into the rich tapestry of Gatton's beloved Anacostia Delta. The cheering crowd leaps to their feet at the show's close-proof positive that this unique DC scene is alive, vibrant as ever and ready to be introduced to the world."

Theirs was a secluded and difficult life, but still a bearable life until the fall of the Mussolini government. When the Republic of Salò was created in the northern areas of Italy, after the September 8th, 1943, armistice with the Allied Armies, who had landed in the Sicily island in the month of July of the same year, the life of the small Jews community turned to the bad.
